## âœ… Improvements in This Fork

This fork of [`intl_phone_field`](https://pub.dev/packages/intl_phone_field) includes a **fix for the `validator` callback**, which was previously not being triggered when used inside a `Form`.

---

### ðŸ”§ What's fixed?

- The `validator` function now works correctly when `IntlPhoneField` is placed inside a `Form` and `FormState.validate()` is called.
- Error messages are displayed properly below the input field.

---

### ðŸ“¦ How to use

```dart
IntlPhoneField(
  validator: (phone) {
    if (phone == null || phone.number.isEmpty) {
      return 'Please enter a valid phone number';
    }
    return null;
  },
  // other properties...
)
```
